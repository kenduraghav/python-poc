== Strings

=== Introduction
A string is a sequence of characters. In Python, strings are immutable, meaning once created, their contents cannot be changed. Strings can be declared using single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`).

=== Creating Strings
You can create a string by enclosing characters in either single or double quotes:

[source,python]
----
message1 = 'Hello, World!'
message2 = "Python is fun!"
----

=== String Operations
Python provides several operations to manipulate strings:

==== String Concatenation
You can concatenate strings using the `+` operator:

[source,python]
----
message = "Hello, " + "World!"
----

==== String Repetition
You can repeat a string using the `*` operator:

[source,python]
----
message = "Python! " * 3
----

==== String Slicing
You can access specific characters of a string using slicing:

[source,python]
----
message = "Python"
first_char = message[0]  # P
last_char = message[-1]  # n
----

==== String Length
The `len()` function returns the length of the string:

[source,python]
----
length = len("Python")  # 6
----

=== String Methods

==== `upper()`, `lower()`
Converts the string to uppercase or lowercase:

[source,python]
----
message = "hello"
print(message.upper())  # HELLO
print(message.lower())  # hello
----

==== `capitalize()`
Capitalizes the first letter of the string:

[source,python]
----
message = "hello"
print(message.capitalize())  # Hello
----

==== `strip()`
Removes leading and trailing spaces:

[source,python]
----
message = "   Python   "
print(message.strip())  # Python
----

==== `replace()`
Replaces a substring with another:

[source,python]
----
message = "Python is awesome"
print(message.replace("awesome", "great"))  # Python is great
----

==== `split()`
Splits the string into a list based on a delimiter:

[source,python]
----
message = "Python is great"
words = message.split()  # ['Python', 'is', 'great']
----

==== `join()`
Joins elements of a list into a string with a separator:

[source,python]
----
words = ['Python', 'is', 'great']
message = " ".join(words)  # Python is great
----

=== String Formatting

==== `format()`
The `format()` method is used to insert variables into a string:

[source,python]
----
name = "Alice"
age = 25
message = "Hello, {}! You are {} years old.".format(name, age)
----

==== f-Strings
Starting from Python 3.6, you can use f-strings for easier string formatting:

[source,python]
----
name = "Alice"
age = 25
message = f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old."
----

==== `title()`
Converts the first letter of each word to uppercase:

[source,python]
----
message = "hello world"
print(message.title())  # Hello World
----

=== String Immutability
Strings in Python are immutable, which means you cannot change individual characters once a string is created:

[source,python]
----
message = "Python"
message[0] = "J"  # Throws an error: 'str' object does not support item assignment
----

=== Comparison and Hashing

==== Equality Comparison
You can compare strings using `==` to check for equality:

[source,python]
----
message1 = "Python"
message2 = "Python"
print(message1 == message2)  # True
----

==== Hashing
Strings are hashable in Python, and you can use them as keys in a dictionary:

[source,python]
----
my_dict = {}
my_dict["name"] = "Alice"
----

=== Conclusion
In this section, we've covered various operations and methods related to strings in Python, including concatenation, formatting, and string manipulation. Strings are immutable and hashable, making them useful as dictionary keys. We also explored the different ways to format and manipulate strings, making it easier to work with text in Python.
