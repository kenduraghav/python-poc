== Classes and Objects in Python

In Python, classes are used to define the structure and behavior of objects. Objects are instances of classes, and they are used to encapsulate data and methods that operate on that data.

=== 1. Introduction to Classes and Objects
A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects. An **object** is an instance of a class.

- A class contains methods (functions) and attributes (variables) that define its behavior and state.
- An object is created based on the class and is known as an instance.

=== 2. Defining a Class
You define a class using the `class` keyword followed by the class name. By convention, class names start with an uppercase letter.

Example:

[source,python]
----
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed

    def bark(self):
        print(f"{self.name} says Woof!")
----

In the example above:
- `__init__` is a special method called the constructor, which initializes the object's attributes.
- `self` refers to the instance of the class and is used to access its attributes and methods.

=== 3. Creating Objects
Once a class is defined, you can create objects (instances) of that class.

Example:

[source,python]
----
dog1 = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")
dog2 = Dog("Max", "Bulldog")

print(dog1.name)  # Output: Buddy
dog2.bark()       # Output: Max says Woof!
----

=== 4. Instance and Class Variables
- **Instance variables** are variables bound to the instance of the class.
- **Class variables** are variables that are shared across all instances of the class.

Example:

[source,python]
----
class Dog:
    species = "Canis Familiaris"  # Class variable

    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        self.name = name  # Instance variable
        self.breed = breed

dog1 = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")
dog2 = Dog("Max", "Bulldog")

print(dog1.species)  # Output: Canis Familiaris
print(dog2.species)  # Output: Canis Familiaris
print(dog1.name)     # Output: Buddy
----

=== 5. Methods
Methods are functions that are defined inside a class. They are used to perform operations on the objectâ€™s attributes.

Example:

[source,python]
----
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed

    def bark(self):
        print(f"{self.name} says Woof!")

dog = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")
dog.bark()  # Output: Buddy says Woof!
----

### 5.1. The `self` keyword
- `self` refers to the instance of the class. It allows you to access the attributes and methods of the class inside its methods.
- It must be included as the first parameter in all instance methods.

=== 6. Inheritance
Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class.

- **Base class** (parent class): The class being inherited from.
- **Derived class** (child class): The class that inherits from the base class.

Example:

[source,python]
----
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        print(f"{self.name} makes a sound")

class Dog(Animal):  # Inheriting from Animal
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        super().__init__(name)  # Call the parent class constructor
        self.breed = breed

    def bark(self):
        print(f"{self.name} barks")

dog = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")
dog.speak()  # Output: Buddy makes a sound
dog.bark()   # Output: Buddy barks
----

In this example:
- `Dog` inherits from `Animal`, meaning it can access the `name` attribute and `speak()` method from `Animal`.

### 6.1. The `super()` Function
The `super()` function is used to call a method from the parent class. It allows a derived class to call methods from its base class.

=== 7. Method Overriding
Method overriding allows a child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its base class.

Example:

[source,python]
----
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        print("Animal speaks")

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print("Dog barks")

animal = Animal()
dog = Dog()

animal.speak()  # Output: Animal speaks
dog.speak()     # Output: Dog barks
----

In this example:
- The `Dog` class overrides the `speak()` method of the `Animal` class.

=== 8. Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the concept of restricting access to certain components and hiding the internal details of an object. It is achieved using **private** and **public** access modifiers.

In Python:
- By convention, attributes and methods with a leading underscore `_` are considered **protected**.
- Attributes and methods with two leading underscores `__` are considered **private** and are name-mangled.

Example:

[source,python]
----
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.__balance = balance  # Private attribute

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.__balance += amount

    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance

account = BankAccount(1000)
account.deposit(500)
print(account.get_balance())  # Output: 1500
# print(account.__balance)  # This will raise an error
----

In this example:
- The `__balance` attribute is private and cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.

=== 9. Conclusion
Python classes and objects are fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming. By using classes, you can model real-world entities and organize your code into reusable components. Inheritance, method overriding, and encapsulation further enhance the flexibility and maintainability of your code.
