== Tuples

=== Overview

A **tuple** is an ordered collection of elements, similar to a list but with one key difference: **tuples are immutable**. Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be modified, added, or removed.

=== Definition

- Tuples are defined using **parentheses** `()`.
- Tuples can store multiple elements of different data types such as integers, strings, or even other tuples.

Example:

[source, python]
----
students = (101, "John", 85.5)
print(students)
# Output: (101, "John", 85.5)
----

=== Accessing Elements

You can access elements in a tuple using **indexing**.

- **Positive indexing** starts at 0, moving left to right.
- **Negative indexing** starts at -1, moving right to left (i.e., -1 for the last element).

Example:

[source, python]
----
students = (101, "John", 85.5)
print(students[0])    # Output: 101
print(students[-1])   # Output: 85.5
----

### Key Points to Remember:
- **Indexing** in tuples works like in lists (0-based for positive and -1 for negative).
- Tuples are **ordered** (the order of elements is maintained).

=== Unpacking Tuples

Unpacking allows you to assign the elements of a tuple directly to variables.

Example:

[source, python]
----
students = (101, "John", 85.5)
id, name, score = students
print(id)     # Output: 101
print(name)   # Output: John
print(score)  # Output: 85.5
----

In this case, the tuple `(101, "John", 85.5)` is unpacked into three variables: `id`, `name`, and `score`.

### Key Points to Remember:
- The number of variables on the left-hand side must match the number of elements in the tuple.

=== Nested Tuples

Tuples can also contain other tuples. This is known as **nested tuples**.

Example:

[source, python]
----
students = (
    (101, "John", ("English", "Math", "Science")),
    (102, "Jane", ("History", "Math", "Art")),
    (103, "Dave", ("English", "History"))
)
print(students[0][2])   # Output: ('English', 'Math', 'Science')
print(students[1][2][1])  # Output: Math
----

In the example above, `students` is a tuple that contains three elements, each of which is also a tuple. The third element in each student's tuple is another tuple of subjects.

### Key Points to Remember:
- **Nested tuples** are useful when you want to store structured data.
- You can access nested elements using multiple indices.

=== Operations on Tuples

- **Concatenation**: You can combine two tuples using the `+` operator.
- **Repetition**: You can repeat a tuple using the `*` operator.
- **Membership test**: You can use the `in` keyword to check if an element exists in a tuple.

Example:

[source, python]
----
tuple1 = (1, 2, 3)
tuple2 = (4, 5)
combined = tuple1 + tuple2
print(combined)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

repeated = tuple1 * 2
print(repeated)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3)

print(3 in tuple1)  # Output: True
----

### Key Points to Remember:
- **Concatenation** combines tuples: `(1, 2) + (3, 4)` gives `(1, 2, 3, 4)`.
- **Repetition** allows you to repeat elements: `(1, 2) * 3` gives `(1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2)`.

=== Tuples vs Lists

The key differences between tuples and lists are:

- **Tuples are immutable**, meaning you cannot modify them after creation, while **lists are mutable**.
- **Tuples** are typically used for fixed collections of items, such as coordinates or records, where you do not need to modify the collection.
- **Lists** are used for dynamic collections where the elements can change.

| Feature       | Tuple                        | List

| Mutability    | Immutable                    | Mutable
| Syntax        | `(element1, element2, ...)`  | `[element1, element2, ...]`
| Use Case      | Fixed collections of items   | Dynamic collections

=== Key Points to Remember

- Tuples are **immutable**, meaning you cannot change them after creation.
- They are **ordered**, and their elements can be accessed via indexing.
- Tuples are useful for **fixed collections** of data.
- Tuples support **nesting**, which allows you to store tuples inside other tuples.
