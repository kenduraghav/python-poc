== File Handling in Python

Python provides built-in functions for reading and writing files. The basic file operations include:

- Opening a file
- Reading from a file
- Writing to a file
- Closing a file

You can also work with file paths and exceptions to make your file operations more robust.

=== Opening a File

[source,python]
----
file = open("filename.txt", "mode")  # modes: "r", "w", "a", "rb", "wb", etc.
file.close()  # Always close after use
----

Or use the context manager (`with`) which auto-closes the file:

[source,python]
----
with open("filename.txt", "r") as file:
    data = file.read()
----

=== Reading from a File

[source,python]
----
# Read entire content
content = file.read()

# Read all lines into a list
lines = file.readlines()

# Read a single line
line = file.readline()
----

=== Writing to a File

[source,python]
----
# Overwrites existing file or creates new one
with open("filename.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, world!\n")

# Appends to the file
with open("filename.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write("New line added.\n")
----

=== Working with JSON Files

[source,python]
----
import json

# Writing a dictionary to JSON file
with open("data.json", "w") as file:
    json.dump({"id": 1, "task": "Go to Gym"}, file)

# Reading JSON data
with open("data.json", "r") as file:
    data = json.load(file)
----

=== File and Path Utilities (os module)

[source,python]
----
import os

cwd = os.getcwd()  # Get current working directory
exists = os.path.exists("filename.txt")  # Check if a file exists
----
